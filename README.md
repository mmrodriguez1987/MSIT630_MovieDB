# Term Project Description and Requirements

* MSIT 630 Database Systems
* Total: 25 points
* Description

You are required to design and implement a small database application to manage any data you are
interested in. Some examples are listed below for your reference:

1. if you have a collection of CDs, you can manage the data of albums, musicians, songs,
companies etc.
2. if you are interested in NBA/NFL games, you can manage the data of players, teams,
coaches, matches etc.
3. you can also manage your favorite movies by storing and manipulating the data of movies,
actors/actresses, directors etc.

## Design and Implementation

Perform the conceptual database design using Entity-Relationship model. You must submit the
Entity-Relationship diagram of your database. In the E-R diagram,

1. there must be at least 4 entities;
2. there must be at least 2 one-to-many/one-to-one relationships;
3. there must be at least 1 many-to-many relationship.

Convert your E-R diagram to logical database model. You are to design the table structure, including all needed attributes for each table. You must submit the relational database schema, which consists of the description of all tables, constraints in your database. For each table, please specify the primary key and foreign keys.

Implement your design using any DBMS. You are required to create all the tables and develop queries in the target DBMS. You must generate and load appropriate, consistent data into your database. Two options are listed below:

1. MySQL: for this option, you must submit the DDL statements you used to create the tables, to define the constraints, and the SQL statements for all the queries;
2. Microsoft Office Access: for this option, you must submit the screen snapshots of design views of all tables and queries. For each query, the equivalent SQL statement must be provided as well. You must also include the database relationships diagram, which shows the
relationships between tables.

For other DBMSs, the requirements are similar to option#1. The bottom line is that you have to submit materials to show how you created the tables and queries.

## Queries
You must design and develop at least 6 queries in your database application, among them,
1. at least 2 queries are multi-table queries;
2. at least 2 queries use SQL aggregate functions;
3. at least 1 query uses subquery;
4. NULL search condition should be used at least once;
5. GROUP BY and HAVING clause should be used as least once
